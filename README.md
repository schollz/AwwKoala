<p align="center">A simple and powerful notepad supporting listifying, encryption, self-destructing messages, and versioning</a></p>

This is a self-contained notepad webserver that makes sharing easy and _fast_. The most important feature here is _simplicity_. There are many other features as well including versioning, page locking, self-destructing messages, encryption, syntax highlighting, content-delivery, and listifying.
